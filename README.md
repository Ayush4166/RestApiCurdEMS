Hello everyone welcome to the Rest Api 
in this project i have made a Employee Management system and we can perform CURD operation 
1.view all the employee in the org
2.view selected employee in the org using id no
3.update the employee data that are pre exists 
4.create new employee details without passing id as it is auto increment
5.delete employee with there id 
*if you want to clone the project the steps you need to change 
1.make a database of your own choice name and a table of name employee and add id as int,first_name ,last_name,email
2.change the name of database and id and password of mysql in the application.property
3.and you are good to go
thank you everyone.
